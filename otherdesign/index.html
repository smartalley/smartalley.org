                <p>Smart Alley devotes itself to fostering a community space focused on revitalization of neglected
                    alley spaces. What was once used as a vibrant social space, the alleys behind certain neighborhood
                    homes have become service oriented, bare and abandoned grounds. We travel house to house, meeting
                    with neighborhood communities and pitching our innovative ideas.
                    Simple solutions such as murals, community gardens, and tiny libraries can transform alleys into
                    welcoming gathering spaces.

                <p>Smart Alley devotes itself to fostering a community space focused on revitalization of neglected
                    alley spaces. What was once used as a vibrant social space, the alleys behind certain neighborhood
                    homes have become service oriented, bare and abandoned grounds. We travel house to house, meeting
                    with neighborhood communities and pitching our innovative ideas.
                    Simple solutions such as murals, community gardens, and tiny libraries can transform alleys into
                    welcoming gathering spaces.

                        <p>By creating a message board, we can connect all of the members in a neighborhood who wish to
                            be a part of it. With this, we can post about upcoming events, collaborate with you, and
                            provide ideas for a better common space. Certain ideas include: implementing free tiny
                            libraries, community bench gardens, improved lighting, murals, and setting up surveillance
                            cameras.
                            <br/>
                            In the message board, we can also organize neighborhood projects such as cleaning parties,
                            barbeques, and art projects, all with the final goal of bringing together the people of the
                            community through a shared common space.
